    <h2 class="h1_1">1. Types of Doors</h2>
           
    
    <strong>

        <p>
                Swing Doors: The most traditional type of door, 
                hinged on one side and swings open in one direction. 
                They can be single or double doors.
        </p>
        <p>
                    Sliding Doors: These doors move horizontally along 
                    a track, commonly used in areas where space is limited.They can be used for interior or exterior applications.
        </p>
        <p>
                Folding Doors: Also known as bi-fold or accordion 
                doors, these consist of panels that fold together, 
                ideal for rooms where space saving is important, 
                such as closets or smaller rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
                French Doors: Double doors that open from the center, 
                often with glass panes from top to bottom. These doors
                provide a sense of openness and light, frequently used
                in patios and entryways.
        </p>
        <p>
                Pocket Doors: Sliding doors that disappear into the 
                wall when open, providing a sleek and space-saving 
                option.
        </p>
        <p>
                Revolving Doors: These doors consist of multiple panels 
                that rotate around a central axis, commonly found in 
                commercial buildings to manage traffic flow and maintain 
                energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
                Dutch Doors: A door divided horizontally into two 
                halves, allowing the top half to open independently 
                of the bottom. They are often used in farmhouses or 
                kitchens.
        </p>
        <p>
                Security Doors: These are reinforced doors designed 
                to protect against intruders and are commonly used in 
                commercial or high-security environments. They are 
                typically made of metal and may include locks, bolts, 
                and other protective mechanisms.        
        </p>

    <h2>2. Materials Used for Doors</h2>

                        <strong>
                            Wood: Traditionally used for doors, wood offers 
                            warmth, aesthetic appeal, and insulation. Types of 
                            wood commonly used include oak, mahogany, and pine. 
                            Wooden doors can be solid or hollow core (lighter and
                            less expensive).

                        <strong>
                            Metal: Steel, aluminum, and wrought iron are often 
                            used for security doors, industrial doors, and exterior 
                            doors due to their durability and strength. Metal 
                            doors can also provide better soundproofing and fire 
                            resistance.

                        <strong>
                            Glass: Often used for exterior doors such as French 
                            doors, patio doors, or sliding doors, glass allows 
                            natural light to pass through. They can be clear, 
                            frosted, or tinted, depending on the level of privacy 
                            needed.

                            Fiberglass: Known for its strength and resistance to weather 
                            conditions, fiberglass doors are commonly used for exterior 
                            applications. They often mimic the appearance of wood but are 
                            more durable and require less maintenance.

                            option, PVC doors are often used for interior applications 
                            or as budget-friendly exterior doors.

                            Composite Materials: These doors are made from a mix of materials 
                            like wood, PVC, and other substances. They provide a balance between 
                            aesthetics, insulation, and cost.

    <h2>3. Parts of a Door</h2>
        <p>A typical door consists of several components:

            Door Leaf (Panel): The main part of the door, which swings or slides to open and close.
            
            Frame: The structure around the door that holds it in place. It includes the door jambs (vertical sides), the head (top), and the sill (bottom) for a doorframe.
            
            Hinges: The metal components that attach the door to the frame and allow it to swing open and closed.
            
            Handle/Knob: The mechanism used to open and close the door. Handles may be knobs, levers, or pulls.
            
            Lockset: A locking mechanism, including a latch, bolt, and any deadbolt or electronic lock. This provides security and privacy.
            
            Threshold: The strip at the bottom of the door frame, often serving to seal the gap between the door and the floor.
            
            Weatherstripping: Material placed around the door frame to prevent drafts and improve insulation.
            
            Sill or Bottom Rail: The part of the door at the bottom that can act as a barrier to water or debris.
            </p>

    <h2>4. Door Functionality and Uses</h2>
            <p>
                Doors serve a variety of purposes in homes, businesses, and other spaces. These purposes can be broadly classified as:
                Privacy: Doors provide privacy by separating rooms or spaces within a building. This is especially important in bedrooms, bathrooms, and offices.

                Security: Doors are a key component of securing a building. Strong, lockable doors prevent unauthorized access and protect valuables.
                
                Insulation: Doors contribute to energy efficiency by insulating the interior of a building. Insulated doors help to maintain temperatures, reducing the need for heating or cooling.
                
                Aesthetic Appeal: Doors are often a focal point in home design and architecture. From ornate wooden doors to sleek modern styles, doors contribute to the overall style and curb appeal of a building.
                
                Soundproofing: Thick doors or those with special seals can provide sound insulation, which is particularly useful in offices, bedrooms, or music studios.
                
                Ventilation and Light: Doors with windows, like French or sliding doors, allow for airflow and sunlight. This can help in reducing the need for artificial lighting and improve indoor air quality.
